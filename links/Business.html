                The next Bill Gates will not build an operating system. The next
                Larry Page won't make a search engine. If you are copying these
                guys, you aren't learning from them. Doing what we already know
                how to do takes the world from 1 to n, adding more of something
                familiar. Every new creation goes from 0 to 1. This book is
                about how to get there.
