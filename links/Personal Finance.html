                Everyone faces big questions when it comes to money: questions
                about saving, investing, and whether you're getting it right
                with your finances. Unfortunately, many of the answers provided
                by the financial industry have been based on belief and
                conjecture rather than data and evidence--until now.

                April of 2022 marks a 25-year milestone for the personal finance
                classic Rich Dad Poor Dad that still ranks as the #1 Personal
                Finance book of all time. And although 25 years have passed
                since Rich Dad Poor Dad was first published, readers will find
                that very little in the book itself has changed -- and for good
                reason. While so much in our world is changing a high speed, the
                lessons about money and the principles of Rich Dad Poor Dad
                haven't changed. Today, as money continues to play a key role in
                our daily lives, the messages in Robert Kiyosaki's international
                bestseller are more timely and more important than ever.
