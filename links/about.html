        My name is Farideh. I'm a computer graduate. My opinion is as a computer
        student, I have tried different fields in my major, so during my
        education went to an internship as a web programmer and mobile
        programmer, and network engineer.I worked in CRI and ECO Regional
        Center, Mashhad, Iran as an IT Support engineer because of my interest;
        I volunteered to start a new website for ECO Regional Center. Because of
        my immigration plan, I had to leave my job, and after arriving in the
        Netherlands, I decided to invest time on myself to improve my Front End
        skills and learn Dutch. Now as a first experience here, I registered for
        a Front End training program in Brainnes company and this is my first
        assignment.
